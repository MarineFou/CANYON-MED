# CANYON-MED

Matlab and R routines to estimate open ocean carbonate system variables and nutirents in the Mediterranean Sea from time, geolocation, together with T, S and O2.

The folders for Matlab and R each contain the CANYON-MED codes and training weights.

To use the CANYON-MED neural networks, download the corresponding folder.
In the "CANYON-MED codes" folder, change the "basedir" in all 6 CANYON-MED functions to the appropriate folder on your computer. This folder is the location of the CANYON-MED folder.
It has to end in "R" or "MATLAB".

To verify the proper installation, apply the function with the check values (i.e. 09-Apr-2014, 35° N, 18° E, 500 dbar, 13.5 °C, 38.6 psu, 160 umol O2 kg-1) and check that the value corresponds to the value line 22.

Do not change the architecture inside the folder or rename any of the files.
